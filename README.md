Hi there, my name is Jan and I'm currently learning C#. I used to code professionally in Delphi 25+ years ago but for one reason or another it didn't pan out.

I'm currently training with [JobLoop](https://www.jobloop.no) (shout-out to all Backender's and Frontender's 👨‍💻) and loving every minute of it. 

I must say, I find C# both "better" than Delphi in that there's no need to free instantiated objects since .dotnet's garbage collector takes care of that, and "more difficult" since the syntax is a bit more obscure, for lack of a better word.
But I really like it.

Right now, I'm working on a text adventure like the old Infocom classics (Stationfall, Planetfall, The Lurking Horror, Plundered Hearts, the Zork games and many more). It uses Classes for the rooms and the player. 
Inventory list for the player has been implemented and of course, removing the item picked up from the specific room the player is in. 
Now comes the hard part; the parser. And the puzzles & storyline.

Stay tuned.
