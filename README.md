Hi there, my name is Jan and I'm currently learning C#. I used to code professionally in Delphi 25+ years ago but for one reason or another it didn't pan out.

I must say, I find C# both "better" than Delphi in that there's no need to free instantiated objects since .dotnet's garbage collector takes care of that, and "more difficult" since the syntax is a bit more obscure, for lack of a better word.
But I really like it.

Right now, I'm working on a text adventure like the old Infocom classics (Stationfall, Planetfall, The Lurking Horror, Plundered Hearts, the Zork games and many more). It uses Classes (and of course, object instantiation. C# is OOP, not COP;-) for the rooms and the player. Stay tuned.
